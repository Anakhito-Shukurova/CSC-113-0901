## Hi everyone! 

**Hi everyone! My name is Anakhito.**


## 🌍 Background

I am from a small country in Central Asia, about the size of Alaska. This is my second year in the United States and my second year studying graphic design.
I speak two languages fluently and am interested in learning two more. One of the languages I would like to learn is Spanish.


## 🤖 INTEREST IN AI

I joined this class to learn more about artificial intelligence, since it has become an important part of our everyday lives.

I have some experience with different AI platforms for various purposes, but I’ve never really taken a deep dive into exploring it's full potential, so my experience with it is still limited.

I’ve been interested in AI for a while now. I’ve spent time reading and watching about it a lot since it started gaining popularity, which made me even more curious about what I can do with it myself.


## 🎨 MY FOO:

My biggest interest since childhood has been painting. Over time, this led me to study human anatomy on my own using books and YouTube videos. I became so interested in the subject that I even considered dedicating my life to medicine, especially becoming a surgeon. For various reasons, I decided not to follow that path and instead continue studying anatomy as a hobby.

I chose to use my skills in graphic design, where I can apply my creativity and artistic abilities. I truly enjoy what I do and do not regret my choice.

📚 Through these experiences, I realized that what I enjoy most is learning. I am a very curious person and like reading and watching content about anything that catches my attention. Recently, my main interest has been artificial intelligence, which is why I am excited to be part of this class!

## 🐞 Fun Facts About Me

I love insects. If you become my friend, be ready to receive pictures of insects I find, or even for me to bring them to you in person (unless you tell me not to do it).
